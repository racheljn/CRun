===================================

I agree that this will be a very useful command!  I get tired of having
to tell GCC that I DON'T want the output file to be named "a.out".

My one concern is that you'll be modifying GCC, which is a bolt-on kind
of utility and isn't all that tightly coupled to the kernel.  However, if
you write it in such a way that you can integrate it into the kernel, that
would certainly fill the bill!

We can discuss this a bit more to make it work.

Very useful idea!!

Project tentatively approved.  Good work and good luck!
